🧳 Problem Statement:
At the heart of this notebook is the Knapsack Problem – a puzzle that challenges us to maximize value under weight constraints. Imagine you have a knapsack with a limited weight capacity and a set of items, each with a specific weight and value. How do you choose which items to pack to get the maximum total value without exceeding the weight limit? This problem finds relevance in numerous real-world scenarios, from packing for a trip to optimizing resource allocation in businesses.

📐 Mathematical Formulation:
The notebook delves into the mathematical modeling of the Knapsack Problem, presenting it as a binary optimization problem. You'll find detailed explanations of the variables, the objective function to maximize the total value, and the constraints to ensure the weight limit isn't exceeded. This section forms the core foundation for understanding the computational approaches to solve the problem.
